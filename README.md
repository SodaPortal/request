## Why?

Postman and lots of similar programs already exist, but they are confusing and have lots of features we don't need.

Since a CLI is not for everyone, aiocat made [request](https://github.com/aiocat/request), an HTTP client for minimalists.

## Created by aiocat

His work was gone after his GitHub account disappeared. I did not create this application but was able to get it working again by hardcoding in English strings wherever the old localization function referenced another now non-existent GitHub repository [aiocat/request-i18n](https://github.com/aiocat/request-i18n) for multiple languages.

This repository's code is from the last version available (1.1.5), however, since the localization repo is no longer available, the app is only in English.
